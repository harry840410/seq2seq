Later that day, when the Princess was sitting at the table, something was heard coming up the marble stairs. Splish, splosh, splish splosh! The sound came nearer and nearer, and a voice cried, "Let me in, youngest daughter of the King."
第二天，小公主跟国王和大臣们刚刚坐上餐桌，才开始用她的小金碟进餐，突然听见啪 啦啪啦的声音。随着声响，有个什么东西顺着大理石台阶往上跳，到了门口时，便一边敲门 一边大声嚷嚷：「小公主，快开门！」
The Princess jumped up to see who had called her. Now when she caught sight of the frog, she turned very pale.
听到喊声，小公主急忙跑到门口，想看看是谁在门外 喊叫。打开门一看，原来是那只青蛙，正蹲在门前。小公主见是青蛙，吓得脸色发白，心里害怕极了。
"What does a frog want with you?" demanded the King, looking rather surprised.
「青蛙想 找你做什么呢？」 国王相当惊讶地问公主。
The Princess hung her head. "When I was sitting by the fountain my golden ball fell into the water. This frog fetched it back for me, because I cried so much." The Princess started to cry again. "I promised to love him and let him eat from my golden plate, drink from my golden cup, and sleep on my golden bed."
公主低下头回答：「昨天，当我坐在水潭边上玩的时候，金球掉到水潭里去了。我哭得很伤心，青蛙就替我把金球捞了上来。」说到这，公主又开始哭了。 「我答应他要爱他，让他用我的小金蝶吃饭，用我的高脚酒杯喝酒，而且还要让他睡在我的床上。
The King looked at the frog and thought for a while before he spoke. "Then you must keep your promise, my daughter."
国王看着青蛙思索，接着说：「女儿，那么你绝不能言而无信。」
The Princess knew she must obey, so she let the frog to come inside. The frog hopped in after her and jumped up into her chair and straight onto the table. "Now push your golden plate near me." said the frog, "so that we may eat together." As she did so, the frog leapt onto her plate and ate up all her dinner, which was just as well, because the Princess didn't feel much like eating.
小公主知道她必须遵从便让青蛙进门了。青蛙蹦蹦跳跳地跟她进了门，然后跳到小公主的座位，并直接跳上餐桌，接着说：「把您的小金碟子推过来一点儿好吗？这样我们就可以一快儿吃啦。」小公主很不情愿这么做，可她还是把金碟子推了过去。青蛙将公主的晚餐全吃光了，而幸好，小公主一点儿胃口都没有。
Next, the frog drank from her little golden cup until it was quite empty. Somehow the Princess didn't feel at all thirsty either! After the frog had finished, he took one great leap and landed on the Princess's knee. "Go away you ugly, cold frog!" she screamed. "I will never let you sleep on my lovely, clean bed!"
接着，青蛙将高脚杯里的酒都喝光，而小公主一点都不觉得渴！青蛙喝完后，便跳到小公主的膝盖上，「走开！你这恶心、冰冷的青哇！」小公主尖叫着：「我绝不会让你睡在我整洁漂亮的的床上！ 」
That made the King very angry. "This frog helped you when you needed it. Now you must keep your promise to him."
国王见小公主这个样子，就生气地对她说：「这只青蛙在妳需要的时候帮助過妳，现在妳必须遵守妳的诺言。」
Very unwillingly the Princess picked up the frog and carried him upstairs to her room. When the frog hopped into the middle of her golden bed, it was just too much for the Princess. She pushed the frog hard and it fell onto the floor. As he fell he was changed into a handsome Prince. A spell had been cast on him by an evil witch and only the Princess had the power to break it.
于是，小公主不情愿地用两只纤秀的手指把青蛙挟起来，带着他上了楼。当青蛙跳到小公主的床中间时，小公主勃然大怒，用力地将青蛙推开并让他狠狠地摔落在地上。而当他一落地，一下子变成了一位王子，原来他被一个狠毒的巫婆施了魔法，除了 小公主以外，谁也不能解救他。
The Princess was speechless. She felt very sorry indeed that she had been so unkind to the frog. After a while, the handsome Prince and the Princess were married, and lived happily ever after.
小公主吓傻了，她对于她的态度及无礼感到非常地愧疚。过没多久，英俊的王子和小公主结婚，从此过着快乐幸福的日子。
It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called: 'Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. 'We will not open the door,' cried they, 'you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!' Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: 'Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.' But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: 'We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!' Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: 'I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.' And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: 'Strew some white meal over my feet for me.' The miller thought to himself: 'The wolf wants to deceive someone,' and refused; but the wolf said: 'If you will not do it, I will devour you.' Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.
没过多久，有人敲门，而且大声说：「开门哪，我的好孩子。你们的妈妈回来了，还给你们每个人带来了一点东西。」可是，小山羊们听到粗哑的声音，立刻知道是狼来了。 「我们不开门，」它们大声说：「你不是我们的妈妈。我们的妈妈说话时声音又软又好听，而你的声音非常粗哑，你是狼！」于是，狼跑到杂货商那里，买了一大块白垩土，吃了下去，结果嗓子变细了。然后它又回来敲山羊家的门，喊道：「开门哪，我的好孩子。你们的妈妈回来了，给你们每个人都带了点东西。」可是狼把它的黑爪子搭在了窗户上，小山羊们看到黑爪子便一起叫道：「我们不开门。我们的妈妈没有你这样的黑爪子。你是狼！」于是狼跑到面包师那里，对他说：「我的脚受了点伤，给我用面团揉一揉。」等面包师用面团给它揉过之后，狼又跑到磨坊主那里，对他说：「在我的脚上洒点白面粉。」磨坊主想：狼肯定是 想去骗什么人，便拒绝了它的要求。可是狼说：「要是你不给我洒面粉，我就把你吃 掉。」磨坊主害怕了，只好洒了点面粉，把狼的爪子弄成了白色。人就是这个德行！
So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said: 'Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.' The little kids cried: 'First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.' Then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.
这个坏蛋第三次跑到山羊家，一面敲门一面说：「开门哪，孩子们。你们的好妈妈回来了，还从森林里给你们每个人带回来一些东西。」小山羊们叫道： 「你先把脚给我们看看， 好让我们知道你是不是我们的妈妈。」狼把爪子伸进窗户，小山羊们看到爪子是白的，便相信它说的是真话，打开了屋门。然而进来的是狼！小山羊们吓坏了，一个个都想躲起来。第一只小山羊跳到了桌子下，第二只钻进了被子，第三只躲到了炉子里，第四只跑进了厨房， 第五只藏在柜子里，第六只挤在洗脸盆下，第七只爬进了钟盒里。狼把它们一个个都找了出 来，毫不客气地把它们全都吞进了肚子。只有躲在钟盒里的那只最小的山羊没有被狼发现。狼吃饱了之后，心满意足地离开了山羊家，来到绿草地上的一棵大树下，躺下身子开始呼呼 大睡起来。
The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.
狼刚拉起门栓，那门就开了。狼二话没说就冲到奶奶的床前，把奶奶吞进了肚子。然后 它穿上奶奶的衣服，戴上她的帽子，躺在床上，还拉上了帘子。
Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.
这时小红帽还在跑来跑去地采花。直到采了许多许多，她都拿不了啦，她才想起奶奶，重新上路去奶奶家。
She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: 'Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.' She called out: 'Good morning,' but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.
看到奶奶家的屋门敞开着，她感到很奇怪。她一走进屋子就有一种异样的感觉，心中便想：「天哪！平常我那么喜欢来奶奶家，今天怎么这样害怕？」她大声叫道：「早上好！」，可是没有听到回答。她走到床前拉开帘子，只见奶奶躺在床上，帽子拉得低低的， 把脸都遮住了，样子非常奇怪。
'Oh! grandmother,' she said, 'what big ears you have!'
「哎，奶奶，」她说，「你的耳朵怎么这样大呀？」
'The better to hear you with, my child,' was the reply.
「 为了更好地听你说话呀，乖乖。」
'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!' she said.
「可是奶奶，你的眼睛怎么这样大呀？」小红帽又问。
'The better to see you with, my dear.'
「为了更清楚地看你呀，乖乖。」
'But, grandmother, what large hands you have!'
「奶奶，你的手怎么这样大呀？」
'The better to hug you with.'
「可以更好地抱着你呀。」
'Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!'
「奶奶，你的嘴巴怎么大得很吓人呀？」
'The better to eat you with!'
「可以一口把你吃掉呀！」
And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap. When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.
狼刚把话说完，就从床上跳起来，把小红帽吞进了肚子，狼满足了食欲之后便重新躺到 床上睡觉，而且鼾声震天。
The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: 'How the old woman is snoring! I must just see if she wants anything.' So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. 'Do I find you here, you old sinner!' said he. 'I have long sought you!' Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red- Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: 'Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf'; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.
一位猎人碰巧从屋前走过，心想：这老太太鼾打得好响啊！我 要进去看看她是不是出什么事了。猎人进了屋，来到床前时却发现躺在那里的竟是狼。 「你这老坏蛋，我找了你这么久，真没想到在这里找到你！」他说。他正准备向狼开枪，突 然又想到，这狼很可能把奶奶吞进了肚子，奶奶也许还活着。猎人就没有开枪，而是操起一 把剪刀，动手把呼呼大睡的狼的肚子剪了开来。他刚剪了两下，就看到了红色的小帽子。他 又剪了两下，小姑娘便跳了出来，叫道：「真把我吓坏了！狼肚子里黑漆漆的。」接着，奶 奶也活着出来了，只是有点喘不过气来。小红帽赶紧跑去搬来几块大石头，塞进狼的肚子。狼醒来之后想逃走，可是那些石头太重了，它刚站起来就跌到在地，摔死了。
Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snow-white still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs' cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, 'Fine wares to sell!' But Snow-white said, 'I dare not let anyone in.' Then the queen said, 'Only look at my beautiful combs!' and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. 'There you may lie,' said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snow-white lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.
知道白雪公主仍然活着，恼怒与怨恨使王后浑身血气翻涌，心里却凉透了。她不甘心， 不能忍受，于是又对自己进行打扮，这次的伪装尽管还是一个老太婆，但却完全不同于上 次。伪装好后，她带上一把有毒的梳子，翻山越岭来到了七个小矮人的房门前，敲着门喊道：「买不买东西哟！」白雪公主在里面听到了，把门握开一条缝说道：「我可不敢让别人 进来了。」王后连忙说道：「你只要看看我这把漂亮的梳子就行了。」说完把那把有毒的梳 子递了进去。梳子看起来的确很漂亮，白雪公主拿过梳子，想在头上试着梳一梳，但就在梳子刚碰到她的头时，梳子上的毒力发作了，她倒在地上，失去了知觉。王后冷笑着说道： 「你早该这样躺着了。」说完就走了。幸运的是这天晚上，小矮人们回来得很早，当他们看见白雪公主躺在地上时，知道一定又发生了不幸的事情，急忙将她抱起来查看，很快就发现了那把有毒的梳子。他们将它拔了 出来，不久，白雪公主恢复了知觉，醒了过来。接着，她把事情发生的经过告诉了他们，七 个小矮人再次告诫她，任何人来了都不要再开门。
Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, 'Snow-white shall die, if it cost me my life.' So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, 'I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.' 'Do as you please,' said the old woman, 'but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.' 'No,' said Snow-white, 'I dare not take it.' 'You silly girl!' answered the other, 'what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.' Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snow-white was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. 'This time nothing will save thee,' said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:
此刻，王后已回到王宫，站在了魔镜前，询问着镜子，但听到的竟还是和上次相同的回 答。这下，她气得浑身都哆嗦起来了，她无法忍受这样的回答，狂叫道：「白雪公主一定要死，即使以我的生命为代价也在所不惜！」她悄悄地走进一间偏僻的房子里，精心制做了一个毒苹果。这苹果的外面看起来红红的，非常诱人，但只要吃一点就会要人的命。接着，她 将自己装扮成一个农妇，翻山越岭又来到了小矮人的房舍，伸手敲了敲门。白雪公主把头从 窗户里探出来说道：「我不敢让人进来，因为小矮人们告诫我，任何人来了都不要开门。」 「就随你吧，」老农妇拿出那个毒苹果说道，「可是这苹果实在是太漂亮可爱了，我就作一个礼物送给你吧。」白雪公主说道：「不，我可不敢要。」老农妇急了：「你这傻孩子，你担心什么？难道这苹果有毒吗？来！你吃一半，我吃一半。」说完就将苹果分成了两半。其 实，王后在做毒苹果时，只在苹果的一边下了毒，另一边却是好的。白雪公主看了看那苹 果，很想尝一尝，因为那苹果看起来很甜美。她看见那农妇吃了那一半，就再也忍不住了， 接过另一半苹果咬了一口。苹果刚一进口，她就倒在地上死去了。王后一见，脸上露出了奸笑，说道：「这次再没有人能救你的命了！」她回到王宫，来到魔镜前，而魔镜最后说：
'Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.'
「是你，王后！你就是全国最漂亮的女人。」
He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking. Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again. "This also is not the right one," said he, "have you no other daughter?" "No," said the man, "There is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the bride." The King's son said he was to send her up to him; but the mother answered, "Oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself!" He absolutely insisted on it, and Cinderella had to be called. She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the King's son, who gave her the golden shoe. Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove. And when she rose up and the King's son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him and cried, "That is the true bride!" The step-mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with rage; he, however, took Cinderella on his horse and rode away with her. As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried --
王子低头一看，发现血正从舞鞋里流出来，连她的白色长袜也浸红了，他拨转马头，同样把她送了回去，对她的父亲说：「这不是真新娘，你还有女儿吗？」父亲回答说：「没有了，只有我前妻生的一个叫灰姑娘的小邋遢女儿，她不可能是新娘的。」然而，王子一定要他把她带来试一试。灰姑娘先把脸和手洗干净，然后走进来很有教养地向王子屈膝行礼。王 子把舞鞋拿给她穿，鞋子穿在她脚上就像是专门为她做的一样。他走上前仔细看清楚她的脸后，认出了她，马上兴奋的说道：「这才是我真正的新娘。」继母和她的两个姐妹大吃一惊，当王子把灰姑娘扶上马时，她们气得脸都发白了，眼睁睁地看着王子把她带走了。他们 来到榛树边时，小白鸽唱道：
"Turn and peep,turn and peep,No blood is in the shoe,The shoe is not too small for her,The true bride rides with you,"
「回家吧！回家吧！快看那只鞋！王妃！這是為你做的鞋！王子！王子！ 快帶新娘回家去，坐在你身邊的才是真正的新娘」
and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed themselves on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there.
鸽子唱完之后，飞上前来，停在了灰姑娘的右肩上，一起向王宫走去。
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.
在他住的那个大城市里，生活很轻松，很愉快。每天有许多外国人到来。有一天来了两个骗子。他们说他们是织工。他们说，他们能织出谁也想像不到的最美丽的布。这种布的色彩和图案不仅是非常好看，而且用它缝出来的衣服还有一种奇异的作用，那就是凡是不称职的人或者愚蠢的人，都看不见这衣服。
"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" thought the Emperor. "Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately." And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.
「那正是我最喜欢的衣服！」皇帝心里想。 「我穿了这样的衣服，就可以看出我的王国里哪些人不称职；我就可以辨别出哪些人是聪明人，哪些人是傻子。是的，我要叫他们马上织出这样的布来！」他付了许多现款给这两个骗子，叫他们马上开始工作。
So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.
他们摆出两架织机来，装做是在工作的样子，可是他们的织机上什么东西也没有。他们接二连三地请求皇帝发一些最好的生丝和金子给他们。他们把这些东西都装进自己的腰包，却假装在那两架空空的织机上忙碌地工作，一直忙到深夜。
"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," said the Emperor at last, after some deliberation, "he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than be is."
So the faithful old minister went into the hall, where the knaves were working with all their might, at their empty looms. "What can be the meaning of this?" thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide. "I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms." However, he did not express his thoughts aloud.
因此这位善良的老部长就到那两个骗子的工作地点去。他们正在空空的织机上忙忙碌碌地工作着。 「这是怎么一回事儿？」老部长想，把眼睛睁得有碗口那么大。 「我什么东西也没有看见！」但是他不敢把这句话说出来。
The poor old minister looked and looked, he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. "What!" thought he again. "Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."
这位可怜的老大臣的眼睛越睁越大，可是他还是看不见什么东西，因为的确没有什么东西可看。 「我的老天爷！」他想。 「难道我是一个愚蠢的人吗？我从来没有怀疑过我自己。我绝不能让人知道这件事。难道我不称职吗？——不成；我决不能让人知道我看不见布料。」
"Well, Sir Minister!" said one of the knaves, still pretending to work. "You do not say whether the stuff pleases you." "Oh, it is excellent!" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. "This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them."
「哎，您一点意见也没有吗？」一个正在织布的织工说。 「啊，美极了！真是美妙极了！」老大臣说。他戴着眼镜仔细地看。 「多么美的花纹！多么美的色彩！是的，我将要呈报皇上说我对于这布感到非常满意。」
Her little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burntout match in her hand.
她的一双小手几乎冻僵了。唉！哪怕一根小火柴对她也是有好处的。只要她敢抽出一根来，在墙上擦一下，就可以暖暖手！最后她抽出一根来。哧！它点燃了，冒出火光来了！当她把手覆在上面的时候，它便变成了一朵温暖、光明的火焰，像一根小小的蜡烛。这是一道美丽的微光！小女孩觉得真像坐在一个铁火炉旁边一样:它有光亮的黄铜圆把手和黄铜炉身。火烧得那么烈，那么暖，那么美！唉，这是怎么一回事儿？当小女孩刚刚伸出一只脚、打算暖一暖脚的时候，火焰就忽然熄灭了！火炉也不见了。她坐在那儿，手中只有烧过了的火柴。
She rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant's house.
她又擦了一根。它点燃了，发出火光来了。墙上有亮光照着的那块地方，现在变得透明，像一片薄纱；她可以看到房间里的东西；桌上铺着雪白的桌布，上面有精致的碗盘，填满了梅子和苹果的、冒着香气的烤鹅。更美妙的事情是：这只鹅从盘子里跳出来了，背上插着刀叉，蹒跚地在地上走着，一直向这个穷苦的小女孩面前走来。这时火柴就熄灭了；她面前只有一堵又厚又冷的墙。她点了另一根火柴。现在她是坐在美丽的圣诞树下面。上次圣诞节时，她透过玻璃门，看到一个富有商人家里的一棵圣诞树；可是现在这一棵比那棵还要大，还要美。
Thousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gailycolored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when-- the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.
它的绿枝上燃着几千支蜡烛；彩色的图画，跟橱窗里挂着的那些一样美丽的，在向她眨眼。这个小女孩把两只手伸过去。于是火柴就熄灭了。圣诞节的烛光越升越高。她看到它们现在变成了明亮的星星。这些星星有一颗落下来，在天上划出一条长长的光线。
And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. "He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard. So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse. The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.
不过从蛋壳里爬出的那只小鸭太丑了，到处挨打，被排挤，被讥笑，不仅在鸭群中是这样，连在鸡群中也是这样。大家都说：「他真是又粗又大！」有一只雄吐绶鸡，生下来脚上就有距，因此他自以为是一个皇帝，他把自己吹得像一条鼓满了风的帆船，来势汹汹地向丑小鸭走来，瞪着一双大眼睛，脸上涨得通红。这只可怜的小鸭不知道该站在什么地方，或者走到什么地方去好。他觉得非常悲哀，因为自己长得那么丑陋，而且成了全体鸡鸭的一个嘲笑对象。这是头一天的情形。后来一天比一天糟。大家都要赶走这只可怜的小鸭；连他自己的兄弟姊妹也对他生气起来。他们老是说：「你这个丑妖怪，希望猫儿把你抓去才好！」于是他妈妈也希望他从未出声。鸭儿们啄他。小鸡打他，喂鸡鸭的那个女佣人用脚来踢他。于是他飞过篱笆逃走了；灌木林里的小鸟一见到他，就惊慌地向空中飞去。
"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks. Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
「這是因為我太醜了！」小鴨想。於是他閉起眼睛，繼續往前跑。他一口氣跑到一塊住著野鴨的沼澤地裏。他在這兒躺了一整夜，因為他太累了，太喪氣了。
In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade. "What sort of a duck are you?" they all said, coming round him.
天亮的时候，野鸭都飞起来了。他们瞧了瞧这位新来的朋友。他们问：「你是谁呀？」 小鸭向他们鞠躬，尽量对大家恭恭敬敬地行礼。
He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. "You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."
「你真是丑得厉害，」野鸭们说，「不过只要你不跟我们族里任何鸭子结婚，对我们倒也没有什么大的关系。」
"Little maiden," said the lord-in-waiting, "I will obtain for you constant employment in the kitchen, and you shall have permission to see the emperor dine, if you will lead us to the nightingale; for she is invited for this evening to the palace." So she went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half the court followed her. As they went along, a cow began lowing.
「小丫头！」侍臣说，「我将为你在厨房里弄一个固定的职位，还要使你拥有看皇上吃饭的特权，但是你得把我们带到夜莺那儿去，因为它今晚得在皇上面前表演一下。」他们一齐走到夜莺经常唱歌的那个树林里去。宫里一半的人都出动了。当他们正在走的时候，一头母牛开始叫起来。
"Oh," said a young courtier, "now we have found her; what wonderful power for such a small creature; I have certainly heard it before.""No, that is only a cow lowing," said the little girl; "we are a long way from the place yet."
「呀！」一位年轻的贵族说，「现在我们可找到它了！这么一个小的动物，它的声音可是特别洪亮！我以前在什么地方听到过这声音。」「错了，这是牛叫！」厨房的小女佣人说。 「我们离那块地方还远着呢。」
Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh. "Beautiful," said the young courtier again. "Now I hear it, tinkling like little church bells.""No, those are frogs," said the little maiden; "but I think we shall soon hear her now:" and presently the nightingale began to sing.
接着，沼泽里的青蛙叫起来了。中国的宫廷祭司说：「现在我算是听到它了——它听起来像庙里的小小钟声。」「错了，这是青蛙的叫声！」厨房小女佣人说。 「不过，我想很快我们就可以听到夜莺歌唱了。」
"Hark, hark! there she is," said the girl, "and there she sits," she added, pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough."Is it possible?" said the lord-in-waiting, "I never imagined it would be a little, plain, simple thing like that. She has certainly changed color at seeing so many grand people around her."
于是夜莺开始唱起来。 「这才是呢！」小女佣人说：「听啊，听啊！它就栖在那儿。」 她指着树枝上一只小小的灰色鸟儿。 「这个可能吗？」侍臣说。 「我从来就没有想到它是那么一副样儿！你们看它是多么平凡啊！这一定是因为它看到有这么多的官员在旁，吓得失去了光彩的缘故。」
"Little nightingale," cried the girl, raising her voice, "our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him." "With the greatest pleasure," said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.
「小小的夜鶯！」廚房的小女傭人高聲地喊，「我們仁慈的皇上希望你到他面前去唱唱歌呢。」「我非常樂意！」夜鶯說，於是它唱出動聽的歌來。
"It sounds like tiny glass bells," said the lord-in-waiting, "and see how her little throat works. It is surprising that we have never heard this before; she will be a great success at court."
「这声音像玻璃钟响！」侍臣说。 「你们看，它的小歌喉唱得多么好！说来也稀奇，我们过去从未没有听到过它。这鸟儿到宫里去一定会逗得大家喜欢！」
"Shall I sing once more before the emperor?" asked the nightingale, who thought he was present. "My excellent little nightingale," said the courtier, "I have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening, where you will gain imperial favor by your charming song."
「还要我再在皇上面前唱一次吗？」夜莺问，因为它以为皇帝在场。 「我的绝顶好的个夜莺啊！」侍臣说，「我感到非常荣幸，命令你到宫里去参加一个晚会。你得用你美妙的歌喉去娱乐圣朝的皇上。」
"My song sounds best in the green wood," said the bird; but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor's wish.
「我的歌只有在绿色的树林里才唱得最好！」夜莺说。不过，当它听说皇帝希望见它的时候，它还是去了。
